## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is a **3D scene created in C++ with OpenGL** for the CS-330 course. The scene represents a realistic **workbench environment** containing objects such as a hammer, toolbox, and wrench, with custom lighting and camera controls.  

The goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with **3D transformations, shader programming, modular code design, and interactive camera controls**.
