## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is a **3D scene created in C++ with OpenGL** for the CS-330 course. The scene represents a realistic **workbench environment** containing objects such as a hammer, toolbox, and wrench, with custom lighting and camera controls.  

The goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with **3D transformations, shader programming, modular code design, and interactive camera controls**.

## 🚀 Features  
- **3D Scene Construction** using primitives (boxes, cylinders, cones, etc.)  
- **Custom Shaders** for realistic lighting and shading effects  
- **Interactive Camera Controls**:  
  - WASD / QE movement  
  - Mouse orbit navigation  
  - Scroll zooming  
- **Lighting Effects** to experiment with mood and realism  
- **Organized Modular Functions** for clean, reusable, and structured code

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CS-330.git
cd CS-330
```

### 2. Download Updated Shader Files  
Ensure you have the **latest shader files** from the `shaders/` folder in this repo. These are required for correct rendering.  

### 3. Extract the Final Project  
Download and extract the `7-1_FinalProjectMilestones.zip` file. Inside, you will find the Visual Studio solution (`.sln`).  

### 4. Open in Visual Studio  
- Launch **Visual Studio (C++ environment)**  
- Open the `.sln` file from the extracted project folder  
- Configure the project (**x64 recommended**)  

### 5. Build & Run  
- Press **Build → Build Solution**  
- Run the project (`Ctrl + F5` or the green play button)
